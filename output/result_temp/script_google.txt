Hello, everyone. First of all, we will like to thank you for your interest, in our research. In this paper, we try to understand how human interaction features such as facial expressions, vocal emotions, and word choices, might influence economic agents decision-making. In order to study this question. Empirically, we build an empirical approach that uses videos of human interactions as data input, and, and machine learning based algorithms as the tool. We applied a couple approached in a setting where early stage Startup pitch, Venture capitalists, for early stage funding. We find that pitch features along visual vocal and verbal Dimensions, all matter for the probability of receiving funding. And we also show that this event impact is largely due to interaction, induced biases, rather than that interactions provide additional valuable information. The empirical structure that you see, in this code example, can hopefully help you to get started with using video in other important settings. Such as Interviews. Classroom recordings. Among many other exciting things will look forward to hearing your feedback and reading about your research. Thank you.
